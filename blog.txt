pages/index.js
delete everything inside the root div instead of <Head/>
customize Head children

image folder in public folder

/component/Layout to shortcut Navbar - page components - Footer

delete everything in /styles/Home.module.css

/pages/_app.js is the view
wrap <Component {...pageProps}> inside the Layout
Nav and Footer will appear in all pages now

we don't need router to route pages
go to /about

styles should be in /styles
example: /styles/Navbar.module.css

/img/
/ cz in public

layout='fill' replaces doing width and height to Image
then add objectFit="contain"

100hv for full screen, but -100px cz Navbar
300vw for full screen

display flex did put them z each other

get rid of horizontal scroll: in container css, overflow: hidden

style={{ transform: `translateX(${-100*index}vw)` }}
on the map wrapper. change images of the featured
-100vw represents one screen
transition: all 1.5s ease-in-out; is it's animation

i'm making the Featured z-index higher than the Navbar and that's looking so cool.

position: relative; the image container
the image wasn't obedient

the htmlFor in the label tag refers to the checkbox id
